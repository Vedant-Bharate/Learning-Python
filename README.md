# Learning-Python
Welcome to the Learning Python repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my journey in learning Python, encompassing various activities, challenges, homework assignments, and coursework challenges completed as part of my Engineering Education (ENED) studies.

## About
In this repository, you'll find a diverse collection of Python activities and challenges undertaken to enhance my programming skills and proficiency in Python. From introductory exercises to advanced projects, each entry represents a milestone in my learning process, showcasing my progress and dedication to mastering Python programming.

## Fall 2023
This section includes all the work I did during the Fall 2023 season. The work mostly focuses on the basics of Python, covering variable and data types, operators, flow control, and loops. Here's an overview of the topics covered:

- **Basics of Python**: Explore fundamental concepts such as variable and data types, operators, and basic syntax in Python.
  
- **Flow Control**: Learn about flow control statements including if, else, and elif statements in Python. Explore examples such as determining even or odd numbers, finding the largest of three numbers, checking leap years, and implementing a basic calculator program.
  
- **Loops**: Delve into different types of loops in Python, including while loops, for loops, and how to use the range() function. Explore examples such as printing the table of a number, using break and continue statements, and implementing various looping scenarios.

## Spring 2024

In Spring 2024, I continued my journey of learning Python and explored more advanced topics. Here's a summary of what I learned:

- **Functions**: Dive into the world of functions in Python, covering topics such as defining functions, applying functions in different scenarios, understanding how functions work, default and keyword arguments, variable-length arguments, parameter passing, and returning multiple values.
  
- **Strings**: Explore various aspects of strings in Python, including escape sequences, raw strings, formatted strings, string operations, string comparison, pattern searching, checking for palindromes, reversing strings, and conversions between decimal and binary.
  
- **Lists**: Learn about list slicing, getting smaller elements, separating even and odd numbers, list comprehensions, calculating the average or mean of a list, counting distinct elements, and checking if a list is sorted.
